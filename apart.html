      Yet there is always the possibility that somewhere, somehow, somewhen, it
      has already been put to use. A possibility which Sammy Merwin here
      considers in highly intriguing and human terms. Let's go back with
      Coulter. . . . Most men of middle age would welcome a chance to live their
      lives a second time. But Coulter did not. He thought of Jurgen, of
      Faust--for in some miraculous way he had reclaimed his youth or been
      reclaimed by it. The face that looked back at him was fresh-skinned,
      unlined, unweathered by life. He saw with surprise, from the detachment of
      almost two decades, that he had been better looking than he remembered.
