            Considered by the Irish Times as one of the most brilliant flights
            of pure fancy ever recorded, this amazing story explores the beauty
            and untamed nature of a faraway world, where wild creatures crowd
            the fantastic landscape and demented torturers dominate victims with
            their bizarre mental powers.

            <p class="name">A Bundle of Letters</p>
            A Bundle of Letters is a humorous story written by an outstanding
            American novelist and literary critic at the turn of the 20th
            century. Henry James lived for many years in Europe and not a long
            time before his death he acquired British citizenship. Most of his
            stories including A Bundle of Letters touch upon the subject of
            morality and consciousness and are philosophical.

              Yet there is always the possibility that somewhere, somehow,
              somewhen, it has already been put to use. A possibility which
              Sammy Merwin here considers in highly intriguing and human terms.
              Let's go back with Coulter. . . . Most men of middle age would
              welcome a chance to live their lives a second time. But Coulter
              did not.

            Elvin wasn't sure how it had started—maybe it was the Schermerhorn
            twins—or the mysterious "meteorite"—or else the world had gone
            crazy.... EXCERPT was nothing on the shelves. Five minutes before
            closing time, he asked the librarian for help. "I don't suppose
            there's anything in," she answered.
